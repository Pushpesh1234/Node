## why putting req.url give only a "/" sign not the whole url from where i am requesting


req.url in Node.js gives you only the path and query string of the URL, not the entire URL with the domain, protocol, and port. This is because the server already knows its own address and doesn't need it included in the request. The browser only sends the unique part of the URL needed to navigate the server's internal file structure.

For example, if you request http://localhost:3000/users?id=123, the req.url will be /users?id=123.

req.url: Contains the path and the query string (/users?id=123).

Protocol and Host: The protocol (http://) and host (localhost:3000) are already known to the server. You can access the host using req.headers.host



## URI and URL Difference

A URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a general term for a string of characters that identifies a resource, while a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a specific type of URI that indicates where a resource is located and how to access it. In essence, all URLs are URIs, but not all URIs are URLs. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
URI (Uniform Resource Identifier):
Purpose:
Identifies a resource, which can be anything from a web page to an image, a document, or even a concept. 
Can be:
A name, a location, or both. 
Example:
"urn:isbn:0-486-27557-4" (a URN, which is a type of URI) identifies a book by its ISBN. 
Syntax:
Includes a scheme, authority, path, query, and fragment (though not all components are always present). 
URL (Uniform Resource Locator):
Purpose:
Specifically locates a resource on the internet and provides the information needed to access it. 
Always includes:
At least a scheme (like "http://" or "https://") and a path. 
Example:
"https://www.example.com/page.html" (a URL) specifies the protocol, domain name, and path to a specific page. 
Relationship to URI:
URLs are a subset of URIs. They provide the address of a resource, while URIs can identify resources in more general ways (e.g., by name). 
In simpler terms:
Think of a URI as a general address for something, while a URL is a specific type of address that tells you how to get to that something. 
Secrets of URIs, URLs, and URNs: Understanding Their ...
For example, your name could be a URI (it identifies you), but it's not a URL (it doesn't tell you where to find you). Your home address, however, is both a URI (it identifies you) and a URL (it tells you where you live).
