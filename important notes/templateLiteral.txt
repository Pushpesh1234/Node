ES6 string literals, also known as template literals or template strings, are a feature introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) that provides a more flexible and powerful way to work with strings in JavaScript compared to traditional single or double-quoted strings.
Key features and advantages of ES6 string literals include:
Backtick Syntax:
They are enclosed within backticks (`` ` ``) instead of single or double quotes.
String Interpolation:
They allow embedded expressions within the string using the ${expression} syntax. This eliminates the need for string concatenation operators (+) and improves readability when incorporating variables or dynamic values into strings.
JavaScript

    const name = "Alice";
    const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`; // greeting will be "Hello, Alice!"
Multi-line Strings: Template literals natively support multi-line strings without requiring explicit newline characters (\n). You can simply press Enter within the backticks to create new lines.
JavaScript

    const multiLineText = `This is the first line.
    This is the second line.
    And this is the third line.`;
Embedded Expressions: Any valid JavaScript expression can be placed inside the ${} placeholder, including function calls, arithmetic operations, and more complex logic.
JavaScript

    const a = 5;
    const b = 10;
    const result = `The sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${a + b}.`; // result will be "The sum of 5 and 10 is 15."
Tagged Template Literals: This advanced feature allows a function to "tag" a template literal, enabling custom parsing and processing of the string and its embedded expressions. This is useful for tasks like safe HTML escaping, internationalization, or creating domain-specific languages (DSLs).
JavaScript

    function customTag(strings, ...values) {
        // Custom logic to process strings and values
        return "Processed String";
    }
    const taggedResult = customTag`Data: ${someValue}`;
In summary, ES6 string literals offer a significantly improved and more convenient way to handle string manipulation, particularly for tasks involving dynamic content, multi-line text, and specialized string processing.
